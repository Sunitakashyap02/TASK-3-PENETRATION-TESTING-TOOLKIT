  * DESCRIPTION

üõ†Ô∏è Task 3: Penetration Testing Toolkit ‚Äî Project Description
‚úÖ Objective
To build a basic Python-based toolkit used for ethical hacking and security testing. This toolkit introduces two common techniques used in penetration testing:

Port Scanning

SSH Brute Force Attack Simulation

The goal is to demonstrate how security testers can identify potential vulnerabilities in a network or server.

üì¶ What the Project Includes
This toolkit is made up of two main modules:

üîç Port Scanner:

Scans a target IP address to find open ports.

Helps identify active services running on a system (e.g., SSH on port 22, HTTP on port 80).

Built using Python‚Äôs socket library.

üîê SSH Brute Forcer:

Attempts to guess the password of an SSH-enabled server using a list of common passwords.

Simulates how brute-force attacks work in real-world scenarios.

Built using the paramiko library (for SSH).

The project also includes:

A command-line interface (CLI) to select tools.

A clean folder structure using Python packages (modules folder).

A requirements.txt file to install dependencies easily.
